\section{Introduction}

The LhARA~\cite{Aymar:2020drr,LhARA:pre-CDR} linear optics package was
written to allow rapid calculations to initiate more detailed studies
of the LhARA beam lines and for use as a tool to check issues as they
arise.
The package has been written in Python so that it is accessible and
can readily be updated, modified and maintained.
At present the code treats proton beams only.

This document presents the approximations and notation used and
summarises the module, class and data structures that have been
adopted.
