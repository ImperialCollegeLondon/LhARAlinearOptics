\section{Introduction}

The LhARA~\cite{Aymar:2020drr,LhARA:pre-CDR} linear optics package was
written to allow rapid calculations to initiate more detailed studies
of the LhARA beam lines and to be used as a tool to check issues are
they arise. 
The package has been written in Python so that it is accessible and
can readily be updated, modified and maintained.
At present the code treats proton beams only.

The documentation presented here is design to present the
approximations and notation in a consistent form and to summarise the
module, class and data structures that have been adopted.
