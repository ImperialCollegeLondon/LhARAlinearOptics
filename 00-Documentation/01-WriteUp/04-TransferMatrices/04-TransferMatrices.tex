\section{Transfer matrices}

Description of beam transport often carried out by:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Breaking lattice down into a series of ``elements'',
    e.g. drift, quadrupole, dipole, solenoid, etc.;
  \item Transport of particle between the start and end of a
    particular element of the lattice linearised such that the trace
    space at the end of the element, $\bm{\phi}_f$, is written in
    terms of the trace space at the start of the element,
    $\bm{\phi}_i$:
    \begin{equation}
      \bm{\phi}_f = \underline{\underline{T}} ~ \bm{\phi}_i \,.
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
Many excellent descriptions of derivation of transfer matrices,
$\underline{\underline{T}}$, so only quote results here.
