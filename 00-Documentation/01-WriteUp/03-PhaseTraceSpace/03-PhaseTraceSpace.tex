\section{Phase space and trace space}

The motion of particles passing through an accelerator is most often
described using classical Hamiltonian mechanics, quantum mechanics
being required only in particular cases such as the description of
spin polarisation in a storage ring.
In classical Hamiltonian mechanics the equations of motion are solved
to give the evolution of the position, momentum, and energy as
functions of a single independent parameter.
The independent parameter is often taken to be time.

Relativistic mechanics exploits four-vector position,
$\underline{\cal{R}} = (\bm{r}, ct)$), and four-vector momentum  
$\underline{\cal{P}} = (c\bm{p}, E)$.
In the Hamiltonian description of particle dynamics, these four
vectors become functions of the independent variable, i.e.
$\underline{\cal{R}} = \underline{\cal{R}}(t)$ and
$\underline{\cal{P}} = \underline{\cal{P}}(t)$.
In the laboratory system, the position of the reference particle along
its trajectory is directly related to the time coordinate by
$t = c \beta_0 s$.
This allows $s$ to be taken as the independent variable and for the
motion of particles in the beam to be derived as function of $s$,
i.e. position along the beam line.

The 6D phase-space coordinates of a particle as a function of $s$ are
(of course) given by the position and momentum three vectors.
The particle energy may be determined from the invariant mass and the
time coordinate from the invariant interval between the origin and the
position defined by $s$.

Para 3:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Phase space is the position of the particle in coordinate and
    and momentun space;
  \item Six phase-space coordinates are required and are usually to
    taken to be $\bm{r}$ and $\bm{p}$;
  \item This section defines the 6-dimensional spaces used to describe
    particle phase space in the linear optics code.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase space}

The 6D phase-space vector is defined in terms of the three-vector
position and three vector momentum as:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix} \bm{r} \\ \bm{p} \end{bmatrix} = 
  \begin{bmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x   \\   y \\ z   \end{pmatrix} \\
                  \begin{pmatrix} p_x \\ p_y \\ p_z \end{pmatrix} \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
The trajectory of the particle may be evaluated as a function of time
or $s$.

\subsection{Trace space}

Trace space is defined to simplify the calculation of the trajectory
of particles through the accelerator lattice and is derived from the
phase space expressed in the RPLC frame.
Consider a particle with position
$(x_{\rm\,RPLC}, y_{\rm\,RPLC}, z_{\rm\,RPLC})$ and momentum 
$p_{\rm\,RPLC}$ with components
$(p_{\rm x\,RPLC}, p_{\rm y\,RPLC}, p_{\rm z\,RPLC})$.
Taking the momentum of the reference particle in the laboratory frame
to be $p_0$, the trace-space coordinates are given by:
\begin{equation}
    \bm{\phi} = \begin{pmatrix}
                  x_{\rm\,RPLC}       \\
                  x\prime_{\rm\,RPLC} \\
                  y_{\rm\,RPLC}       \\
                  y\prime_{\rm\,RPLC} \\
                  z_{\rm\,RPLC}       \\
                  \delta_{\rm\,RPLC}
                \end{pmatrix} \, ;
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{eqnarray}
  x\prime_{\rm\,RPLC}  & = & \frac{\partial x}{\partial s} = \frac{cp_{x\,{\rm\,RPLC}}}{cp_0} \, ; \\
  y\prime_{\rm\,RPLC}  & = & \frac{\partial y}{\partial s} = \frac{cp_{y\,{\rm\,RPLC}}}{cp_0} \, ; \\
  z_{\rm\,RPLC}        & = & \frac{s}{\beta_0} - ct = \frac{\Delta s}{\beta_0}                    \, ; \\
  \delta_{\rm\,RPLC}   & = & \frac{E}{c p_0} - \frac{1}{\beta_0} = \frac{\Delta E}{cp_0}          \, {\rm ; and}
\end{eqnarray}
$\Delta s$ and $\Delta E$ are the differences between the reference
particle position, $s_0$, and its energy, $E_0$, and the position and
energy of the test particle, $s$ and $E$ respectively.  
$\Delta s$ and $\Delta E$ are given by $\Delta s = s - s_0$ and
$\Delta E = E - E_0$.
