# UserDirectory

The idea of this UserDirectory is that you can copy it to a scratch area and use the code in the main repository
in a way that keeps your work separate from the main logic of the software.

## To set up and run:

The first thing that you should do is to follow the setup instructions in the main repository.

* You should already have created the virtual environment (venv).
* You should have already installed the files in "requirements.txt".
* If you were using Anaconda and have (base) activated I recommend disabling with "conda deactivate".
* If you are on a Mac and "echo $SHELL" displays "/bin/zsh" you should start a bash shell by running "bash".
* You need to activate the virtual environment (source venv/bin/activate).
* For workflows based on this UserDirectory it's not necessary to source the startup.bash script in the main repository.
