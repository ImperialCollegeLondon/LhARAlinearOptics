---- In Frankfurt:
 - Fix Read:
   - Realise can (should?) regenerate reference particle, so, just write
     particles. works!
   - Now need to rerun tests, so:

ReReRun tests:
 - BeamLineElementTst.py   - OK
 - DRACOfacilityTst.py     - OK -- but; upgraded clean up at the end of
                                the generation meant that code to find one
				event that made it to the end falled.  Fix
				later.
 - DefocusQuadTst.py       - OK
 - DipoleTst.py            - Fails as before.
 - DriftTst.py             - OK
 - FocusQuadTst.py         - OK
 - LIONfacilityTst.py      - OK - comments as for DRACO
 - LhARAFacilityTst.py     - OK 
 - LhARASourceTst.py       - OK
 - OctupoleTst.py          - Fails as before.
 - ParticleTst.py          - OK
 - PhysicalConstantsTst.py - OK
 - ReferenceParticleTst.py - OK
 - RFCavityTst.py          - Fails as before.
 - RunSimulationTst.py     - OK
 - SimulationTst.py        - OK
 - SolenoidTst.py          - OK
 - SourceTst.py            - OK
 - TestWrite.py            - OK
 - TestRead.py             - OK

Run scripts:
 - RunDRACOsimulation.py   - OK
 - ReadDRACOsimu.py        - OK
 - RunLIONsimulation.py    - OK
 - ReadLIONsimu.py         - OK
 - plotTrajectory.py       - OK, but plotting reference particle, so boring.


---- In RAL car, on flight:
Implemented referene particle, now rerun all tests etc.:

Run tests:
 - BeamLineElementTst.py   - OK
 - DRACOfacilityTst.py     - OK after phase -> trace space
 - DefocusQuadTst.py       - OK
 - DipoleTst.py            - Fails as before.
 - DriftTst.py             - OK
 - FocusQuadTst.py         - OK
 - LIONfacilityTst.py      - OK after phase -> trace space
 - LhARAFacilityTst.py     - OK
 - LhARASourceTst.py       - OK
 - OctupoleTst.py          - Fails as before.
 - ParticleTst.py          - OK after phase -> trace space
                             Had also to add Success flag to
			     setReferenceParticle.  So, loop back to tests.
			     OK as documented above.
 - PhysicalConstantsTst.py - OK
 - ReferenceParticleTst.py - OK -- had to fix cleaning!
 - RFCavityTst.py          - Fails as before.
 - RunSimulationTst.py     - OK after phase -> trace space
 - SimulationTst.py        - OK
 - SolenoidTst.py          - OK
 - SourceTst.py            - OK
 - TestRead.py             - Fails; does not handle reference particle.
 - TestWrite.py            - Made to run, but, does not handle reference
                             particle.
Loop back!  ReRun tests:
 - BeamLineElementTst.py   - OK
 - DRACOfacilityTst.py     - OK
 - DefocusQuadTst.py       - OK
 - DipoleTst.py            - Fails as before.
 - DriftTst.py             - OK
 - FocusQuadTst.py         - OK
 - LIONfacilityTst.py      - OK
 - LhARAFacilityTst.py     - OK (had to clean reference particle to allow
                                 singleton test)
 - LhARASourceTst.py       - OK
 - OctupoleTst.py          - Fails as before.
 - ParticleTst.py          - OK (had to clean reference particle to allow
                                 singleton test)
 - PhysicalConstantsTst.py - OK
 - ReferenceParticleTst.py - OK
 - RFCavityTst.py          - Fails as before.
 - RunSimulationTst.py     - OK
 - SimulationTst.py        - OK
 - SolenoidTst.py          - OK
 - SourceTst.py            - OK
 - TestRead.py             - Fails; does not handle reference particle.
 - TestWrite.py            - Made to run, but, does not handle reference
                             particle.

Run scripts:         <------  Not yet!  Need to fix read/write first.
