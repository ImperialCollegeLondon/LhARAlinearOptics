So, need to re-run tests!

 Updates:
  - Correct z and s in trackLION so that phase space is record at the end of
    element.
  - Some comment updates.  Some fixes of addressing Debug and instance class
    attributes in LIONbeam.

  - Rerun tests:
    - All tests pass of fail as below.
  - Rerun scripts:
    - Tidied some print out.
    - Scripts run OK.

Analysis:
  - Had a go at fiddling the paramters with Riddhi's and Maria's emails.
    Some success.  One peak now.  Need to check the details again.
  - Need to worry about memory leak issues in read/write in particle.
    Fixed in write.  Read should be left as is an handled in code.

 Adress failed tests relevant to LION beamline:
  - LIONfacility.py: just needed to fix addressing of x2calc etc. in ploting
                     section.
  - RunSimulation.py: Added back setSourcePhaseSpace into Particle for
                      backward compatibility.
  - LhARAFacilityTst and LhARASourceTst:
                      Updates for RunSimulation made these work too.

 Start to make significant mods agreed with RIddhi:
  - Beam line elements get a "name"
  - Particle gets a list of named positions, with z and s, where phase space
    is recorded.

  - Mods made to:
    - 01-Code: BeamLineElement and Particle
               - Not yet fixed write and read in Particle

    - Tests:
      - BeamLineElementTst.py   - OK
      - DefocusQuadTst.py       - OK
      - DipoleTst.py            - Fails: comparison of bend with expected bend
