Back to LhARA:
 - Took Will's madx file and impplemented b/l elements from source to end
   of linear trannsport.
 - Created Run and Read in Scripts for LhARA.

 * Now need to loop back to make the trace-space vector the one that is now
   in the documentation.

 - Now done.  And, names on plots for plot progression tidied.

 - Now also made transition Ctr->Strt, seems to work.  Run tests etc:

Tests:
 - BeamLineTst.py          - OK
 - BeamLineElementTst.py   - OK
 - DRACOfacilityTst.py     - OK
 - DefocusQuadTst.py       - OK
 - DipoleTst.py            - OK
 - DriftTst.py             - OK
 - FocusQuadTst.py         - OK
 - GaborLensTst.py         - OK
 - LIONfacilityTst.py      - OK
 - LhARAFacilityTst.py     - OK
 - OctupoleTst.py          - Runs, but, reports difference with expected result
 - ParticleTst.py          - OK
 - PhysicalConstantsTst.py - OK
 - RFCavityTst.py          - Fails with "bad beamline element" interupt
 - ReferenceParticleTst.py - OK
 - RunSimulationTst.py     - OK
 - SimulationTst.py        - OK
 - SolenoidTst.py          - OK 
 - SourceTst.py            - OK 
 - TestRead.py             - OK
 - TestWrite.py            - OK

Run scripts:
 - RunDRACOsimulation.py   - OK
 - ReadDRACOsimu.py        - OK -- Runs OK, but, not sure I understand plots.
 - RunLIONsimulation.py    - OK -- Runtime warning in first event ... sqrt(k)
 - ReadLIONsimu.py         - Fails! only 4 plots, bad distributions.
 - RunLhARAsimulation.py   - OK
 - ReadLhARAsimu.py        - OK
 - plotTrajectory.py       - OK

Hmmpf!  Need to fix LION, and probably DRACO!
 - Issues with setTransfer and 6D matrices, back to basics, fix tests and
   work through from beginning.  Mods were to make the reference particle
   be used properly once on set up of each BLE.

More updates:
 - Fix description of transfer matrix for drift in w/u;
 - Add time (z) dependence to Drift transfer matrix in BeamLineElement.
